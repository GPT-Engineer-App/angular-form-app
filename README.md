# angular-form-app

Build an Angular app with 2 pages. First page has a form with fields Name, email, phone number and address which are required fields and validation errors needs to be shown if user is not entering the data or if they enter invalid data. There is a submit button also in the form. When the user clicks the submit button, the app is navigated to the second page where all the details entered in the first page's form is shown in the second page.
